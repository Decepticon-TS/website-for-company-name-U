# Website-Name

Currently if your run convert.py, it outputs a company name with a website domain name that it believes is the official company website

You'll need to have previously installed:
- urllib
- json
- urlparse 
- pyenchant

To do:
- For each website output, say how confident I am about it being a match using training data (*need to get training data)
- Convert from company websites to company names
